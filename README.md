## Project Overview

Smart Campus Assistant provides a centralized platform for managing campus operations digitally.

It includes different panels for:

- Admin
- Faculty / Teacher
- Student

Each role has access to specific features based on permissions. The application is built with a scalable MERN architecture and follows a clean separation between frontend, backend, routes, controllers, models, middleware, and services.

This project was originally created as an academic project and has been prepared as a demo-safe MERN portfolio project using anonymized/sample data.

## Demo Safety Notes

This project is prepared as a demo-safe portfolio project.

- Real academic data should not be used in public deployment.
- Demo deployment should use anonymized sample data.
- Private documents, PPT files, PDFs, and college-related documentation should not be committed to GitHub.
- Sensitive credentials must be stored only in deployment dashboards such as Render and Vercel.
- .env files are not included in the repository.
